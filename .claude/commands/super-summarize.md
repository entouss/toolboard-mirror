Summarize the local git changes (staged, unstaged, and untracked) since the last commit as a single-line super-condensed message.

Rules:
- One word per change in camelCase (e.g. base64Encoder, markdownRenderer)
- Prefix with + if the file/feature is newly added
- Suffix with ++ if an existing file/feature was enhanced or modified
- All on one line, space-separated
- No punctuation, no explanations, just the summary line
