# Toolboard Documentation

A browser-based widget workspace — a customizable dashboard where users add, arrange, and resize tool windows across multiple boards. Pure client-side: single HTML file + plugin JS files, no build system, no backend, all state in localStorage.

## Development

No build or lint step. Open `index.html` directly in a browser. Refresh to see changes.

Tests live in `tests/` and drive a real Chrome through Playwright:

```
node tests/run.mjs              # everything
node tests/run.mjs curr-grid    # just the suites whose name contains that
```

See [tests/README.md](../tests/README.md).

External dependencies (loaded via CDN): `html2canvas` (screenshots), `marked.js` (markdown rendering), Google Fonts.
