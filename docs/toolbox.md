# Toolbox Plugins

## Plugin Structure (e.g., `developer-tools.js`)

Each toolbox file follows this pattern in order:

1. **CSS IIFE** — injects a `<style>` element with all tool styles, guarded by an ID check to prevent duplicate injection
2. **Toolbox registration** — `PluginRegistry.registerToolbox()` with a `tools` array listing all tool IDs
3. **Tool registrations** — one `PluginRegistry.registerTool()` per tool, with inline HTML `content` and `onInit` function name
4. **Functions** — all tool logic as top-level functions (must be global for `onclick` handlers)
5. **Export IIFE** — collects all function references into `functionsToExport` array, serializes them into a `<script>` tag for HTML export support

## Existing Toolbox Plugins

- `plugins/toolboxes/core-tools.js` — Checklist (✨ breaks a goal into steps, says what next), Simple Calculator
- `plugins/toolboxes/productivity-tools.js` — Agenda Timer (✨ drafts a plan, writes up a run), Kanban Board (✨ drafts cards, writes a status update), Pomodoro Timer, Unit Converter, Playback Speed Calc, Calendar, Random Picker, Dice Roller, Stopwatch, YouTube Embed
- `plugins/toolboxes/developer-tools.js` — Diff Viewer (edited in place, side by side or inline, with no Edit/Both/View; says when the two are identical or only look it; a change stripe down the side, as in IntelliJ, with ↑/↓, Alt+↑/↓ and F7/Shift+F7 to step through the changes; invisible characters drawn and tidied), Sequence Diagram, JWT Decoder, Code Formatter, Cron Expression, Regex Tester, Epoch Converter, IP Address Info, and others
- `plugins/lib/codemirror-merge.js` — CodeMirror 6 and its merge view, bundled into one pinned file by `plugins/lib/build-codemirror.sh` (loaded from a CDN module by module, its packages come at several versions and CodeMirror refuses to mix them). The Diff Viewer loads it when shown, from beside its toolbox; where it cannot, the difference is shown to read.
- `plugins/toolboxes/diagram-tools.js` — Mermaid Diagram (✨ draws one from a description, changes it, fixes a syntax error, explains it), Sequence Diagram, Family Tree, Diagram

- `plugins/toolboxes/project-tools.js` — Project Table (T-shirt sizing, deadlines, and the Gantt chart they imply; ✨ drafts rows and breaks a row down, for the table to schedule, and writes a status update and the risks; in Both, a timeline of this quarter and the next three and this half and the next, with their dates, and under the quarters their timeboxes, sprints and planning week, between the table and the chart — it is also the divider that shares the height between them)
- `plugins/toolboxes/school-tools.js` — Curriculum Builder, Curriculum Doctor, Curriculum Explorer
